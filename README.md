# Data-Visualizations-R
This repo is dedicated to Exploratory Data Analysis in R.

## 1. Basic Usage of GGPlots
In the r-markdown file BasicGGPlots explores simple data visualization with the ggplot2 library. Two datasets, anespilot and cats weight data are used for visualizations. For further analysis on what these charts mean, please read the BasicGGPlots file. Below shows the output of the code:

### Cat weights from Fisher

### Thermometer Feeling Distribution of Presidential Candidates

### Immigration score over Mean Thermometer Feelings of Presidential Candidates

## 2. Loess/Robust Linear Modeling/Linear Modeling
In the r-markdown file Linear Modeling, it shows fitting various variables to models (height/weight/age) to determine best predictors for blood pressure levels in men and women. For each variable there are two graphs, one that shows the relationship and residual plot. Loess modeling, robust linear modeling, and linear modeling were used for this analysis. For more context on what these graphs represent, please read hte Linear Modeling markdown file.
